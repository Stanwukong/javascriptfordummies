# This folder contains my practice of string concatenation and substrings.
So today I used a couple more methods of slicing strings instead of just using the substring() method, namely;
.slice() = slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.
			The method takes 2 parameters: start position, and end position (end not included).
.substr() = substr() is similar to slice().
			The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.

I also practiced other string methods as well.
.replace() = The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string
.split() = A string can be converted to an array with the split() method
