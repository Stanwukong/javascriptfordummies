So today I used a couple methods of slicing strings, namely;

.slice() = slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.
			The method takes 2 parameters: start position, and end position (end not included).
substring() is similar to slice().
			The difference is that start and end values less than 0 are treated as 0 in substring().
.substr() = substr() is similar to slice().
			The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.

I also learned about string literals(very useful things)



NOTE: Automatic replacing of variables with real values is called string interpolation.
